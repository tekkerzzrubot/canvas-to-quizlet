Simple script to convert an HTML file of a completed Canvas quiz to a Quizlet flashcard set. 

This project was started out of need, and served as a good exercise in parsing HTML with Regex (something I'm utilizing in a larger future project.)

## This is an updated fork that has been fixed to work with canvas HTML files

## Usage
You should begin with a completed Canvas quiz, where correct answers are marked:

Hit Ctrl-S to save the html file of the quiz. Run the script, `canvas-to-quizlet.py`, and when prompted paste the location of the quiz .html file into the Python console. Then paste the location of the desired output .txt file -- if none exists, one will be created. 

Copy the entirety of the .txt file and import into Quizlet by creating a new set and selecting "+ Import from Word, Excel, Google Docs, etc." and pasting. Happy studying!

## Notes
* Regardless of what you answered for a question, only the correct answer will be extracted
* Questions containing an image or table will not work (planned to be fixed)
* Questions with the answer "All of the above" will be removed
